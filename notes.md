# Notes

## Top of the list reminders

- Do not trust all interview data as occasionally contradictory memories of how the system behaves
- Known or suspected bugs in the legacy system must be preserved in the output
    - Seems like ay 5 has some intresting behavior
- The private data days traveled goes up to 14
- Intresting that order of when things are submitted might matter? might want to look into that 
- important to not overfit to the public data set

## TODO

- Bug/Outlier Identification: We identified a recurring issue where some trips with high receipt amounts result in unusually low reimbursements. We have isolated these 8 "bugged" cases and are setting them aside for now to avoid corrupting our main analysis.
