# RULES
- Using the conda env of `top-coder-challenge`
- NEVER DELETE FILES or use the rm COMMAND. If you find a file distracting put `old_` on the front or `_v{version}`
- THE GOAL IS TO MATCH THE BLACK BOX ALGO. DO NOT TRY TO IMPROVE IT.
- Update progress in [Current_Cursor_thoughts.md](mdc:Current_Cursor_thoughts.md)
